Abstract
--------
Recently, rice genomes were sequenced in multiple individuals spanning three
species. The phylogenetic relationship of these could have been resolved using
the data set. The method developed in BEAST was not able handle the data set
presumably because the sequence data were not informative enough. Instead, the
authors (Molina 2011) used site-frequency spectrum to sidestep the problem. They
took advantage of other data sets not the data set they obtained. Here, we
consider that
